Code Repo for www.wammyip.com

This website was built using Astro, and vanilla CSS and Javascript

Before building this website, I completed the Fundamentals course
at The Odin Project, and began working through the Google Digital
Marketing Certificate. I knew that in order to build a website like
this one I would need to start with designing it.

I used Adobe XD to design the website, and below you will find a
copy of the original template. This original template was done
in black and white, so that I could best determine where to place light
and dark colors. It also didn't include any images, as I was unsure
what images to add in.

I decoded that I wanted to build the website and see it up and running,
and from there I could do more research in my downtime to determine what
images would be best to use within the site to make it the most user
friendly and appealing it could be.
